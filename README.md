# Customer Intelligence
Project Work of the Customer Intelligence course at Luiss University

## Market segmentation via clustering

# Task
● Data is related to customer transactions: analyze the data (data visualization is
appreciated).
● Use the transactions in order to generate a “spending score” for each user.
○ It can be given by the amount of money spent by each customer.
● Use the transactions in order to generate a “frequency score” for each user.
○ It can be given by the number of invoices related to each user.
● Use clustering techniques (like K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering) to
perform market segmentation based on spending and frequency scores.
● Identify the proper number of clusters, evaluating different options.
● Describe the properties of the clusters you have identified.
○ Describe the properties of the customers belonging to each cluster.
